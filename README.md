# Student-Success-repo
Entry for the Student Success Prediction Hackathon 2025. We use anonymised demographic, academic and application data to build fairness-aware models that predict an applicantâ€™s progress score (1-5) through multi-stage selections in South Africa. This repo contains data prep, modelling, notebooks, evaluation code, and the final report.
